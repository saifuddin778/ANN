ANN
===
A set of single-perceptron based artificial neural networks implemented on different platforms. All the implementations follow the identical logic of :
* Training data being provided as n-dimensional vectors.
* Training labels being provided as a 1-D array containing label values.
Single perceptron based neural networks follow the logic of finding the best hyperplane for a linearly separable dataset. By this, it means that if there exists a solution, this type of neural network is supposed to find it.
